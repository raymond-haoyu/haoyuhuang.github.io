<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a master's student at the School of Journalism and Communication, Wuhan University. My superivisor is <a href="[https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Shiwen-Wu-2195195802]"> Professor Shiwen Wu</a> . At present, I am seeking a Ph.D. opportunity. In the second year of my postgraduate, I had the honor to participate in an exchange program at National Chengchi University (NCCU), where I studied Mixed Research methods, Global Communication and Social Movement, Contemporary Chinese Society studies at the College of Communication and Graduate Institute of East Asian Studies.


My research interest includes Culture, History and Activism in Chinese Internet, Cross-Cultural Memory and Communication, Mediatization of society. In my future research, I hope to conduct more comparative journalism studies related to cross-cultural memory, as well as explore the discourse construction and meaning interpretation of public events by different cultural groups on social media platforms.
