<div id="about-me"></div>

I am currently a master's student at the School of Journalism and Communication, Wuhan University. My superivisor is <a href="[https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Shiwen-Wu-2195195802]"> Professor Shiwen Wu</a> . At present, I am seeking a Ph.D. opportunity. In the second year of my postgraduate, I had the honor to participate in an exchange program at National Chengchi University (NCCU), where I studied Mixed Research methods, Global Communication and Social Movement, Contemporary Chinese Society studies at the College of Communication and Graduate Institute of East Asian Studies.


My research interest includes **Culture, History and Activism in Chinese Internet**, **Transcultural Memory and Communication**, **Media and Cultural Theory**, **Media and Nationalism**, **Computer-aided Text Analysis**. In my future research, I hope to conduct more comparative studies related to conflict news, international events and transcultural memory.
